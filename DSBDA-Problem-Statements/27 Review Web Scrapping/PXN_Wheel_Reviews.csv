0,hi,India on 10 June 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good wheel for the price,it is one of the only wheels which include shifter with 900 degree rotation and it is of good quality but would be better with force feed back :)
1,Sumayya khan,India on 31 May 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,No gear available 😕 and quality is not nice.,                    The media could not be loaded.                In this price the quality is really low.
2,Ha Van Dong,Japan on 13 May 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pc に向かってない。,PCゲームに購入した。Raceroom と Forza Horizon5 をプレイしたけど。Race room は問題なかった、普通に動作しています。しかしいろんな設定が必要。Forza Horizon5 には全然動かない。ハンドルにも傾いている、完成度はちょっと残念。ハンドルはいいじゃないかと思って使い続けよとしたが。Forza Horizon5 に使えないので返品した。あとはブレーキペダルとクラッチペダルはひとつみたいですが。設定するときにどっち踏んでも同じ機能。
3,Debbie Earley,the United States on 14 April 2024,5.0 out of 5 stars,As pictured,"Great price for everything you get, works great"
4,Miyazaki,Japan on 26 April 2023,2.0 out of 5 stars,おすすめはしない,新品で購入した者ですが、ステアリング(ハンドル)のセンター部分がシールだったせいなのか、剥がれていたり、ps4版のGT7(グランツーリスモ7)をプレイしている時、しばらく使うとステアリングが反応しなくなったり、シフトが反応しなかったりしました。なので購入するのであればpxn社製の物よりもっと性能が良い、Logicool社製の物などを選んだ方が良いと思います。

6,Kwaye,the United States on 25 February 2023,1.0 out of 5 stars,Will be returning,"I bought this for ATS, NASCAR Racing and a few other driving games.  Setup took most of the day.  It worked with NASCAR.  Set up the buttons for ATS and Motor Town.  The buttons worked.  The shifter worked with multiple attempts to get right.  The accelerator and brake pedals were reversed and the clutch wouldn’t work without duplicate axis.  Recalibrated multiple times.  Did not like the fact that I have to use an App every time I want to switch games.  The second day the NASCAR wasn’t recognized.  The wheel is very solid material and nice vibration effects.  I had a DOYO prior with a sequential shifter that was more plug and play.  I “upgraded” to this wheel after my shifter stopped working.  The DOYO is a cheaper quality but more user friendly.  I watched a lot of videos on this wheel prior to purchasing and I liked the rotation switch on the wheel and the fact that it came with the shifter.  I wish it set up easier and did not require an app to calibrate.  I used this on a gaming PC."
7,Andrew Nelson,the United States on 29 May 2022,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good For The Once A Month User,"This thing is cool for sure, a few problems worth note is that the gear shift is kinda wacky to click in, the clamps get in the way if your table is low, the pedals don’t start giving input until you’ve depressed about half way and the suction cups are not functional on any of my tables. Other than that great product that I use every now and then, if you’re gonna use it daily get a higher quality one."
8,Gustavo techera,the United States on 1 March 2024,5.0 out of 5 stars,Muy buenos,Muy buenos
9,Sean,the United States on 25 April 2023,3.0 out of 5 stars,My wheel isn’t straight,My wheel isn’t straight and when it’s center it’s pulls the car to the left but the wheel is off to the right
